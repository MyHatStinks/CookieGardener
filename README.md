# CookieGardener

Cookie Gardener is a collection of utilities and improvements for Cookie Clicker's garden minigame.

## What's included?

#### Plot Tooltips
Hover over an empty plot in your garden to see what might grow there on the next tick, along with percentage chance of each plant spawning.

#### Seed Tooltips
Hover over a seed in your seed log and it will tell you which other plants you can use to mutate into it, along with the chance of each mutation happening.

#### Seed Log
Locked plants are now visible in your seed log so you can tell at a glance which seeds are still needed.

#### Next Tick
Display which plants your garden might grow in the next tick, along the the percent chance of each type of plant.

#### Next Available Seeds
Show which plants you could create using only your current seeds.

#### Plant Aging
Long-lived plants will no longer freeze progress or skip ticks. This does not impact the average growth rate of plants, but does allow you to better keep track of growth progress.
